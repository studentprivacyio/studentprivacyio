# Your Rights

<Note type="warning" class='mb-4'>This is not legal advice nor anything similar. Do not rely on this information.</Note>

Several federal laws work together to protect student privacy. Here's what you need to know about each one and how they protect you.

<Note type="info">This guide draws from information provided by <u><a href="https://studentprivacycompass.org/">Student Privacy Compass</a></u>. If you want to learn more about student privacy, you can check out their website.</Note>

## Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA)

While CIPA isn't primarily a privacy law, it affects student privacy in important ways. Under CIPA:

- Schools receiving certain federal funding must:
  - Monitor student activity online and filter for adult content
  - Tracking of student activity online is not required
  - Teach digital citizenship
  - Include online privacy and safety in their curriculum

### The Privacy Impact

CIPA's requirements mean schools must balance:
- Keeping students safe online
- Protecting student privacy
- Maintaining appropriate monitoring levels
- Teaching students to protect their own privacy

## Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)

FERPA is the cornerstone of student privacy protection in the United States. Passed in 1974, it gives you (or your parents, if you're under 18) specific rights over your educational records.

### Your Rights Under FERPA

You have the right to:

- **Inspect Your Records**: You can review any records the school maintains about you
- **Request Corrections**: If you find inaccurate or misleading information, you can ask for it to be changed
- **Control Information Sharing**: The school needs your written consent before sharing your records with others
- **File Complaints**: If you believe your FERPA rights have been violated, you can complain to the Department of Education

### Important FERPA Details

FERPA requires schools to get written consent before sharing your information with others. However, there are some exceptions where schools can share information without consent â€“ but these exceptions must:
- Directly benefit students
- Include specific privacy protections
- Be used only for legitimate educational purposes

## Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA)

PPRA protects you from being forced to reveal sensitive personal information in school surveys. Under this law:

- Schools must notify parents annually about upcoming surveys
- Parents can review survey materials before they're given to students
- Depending on who's funding the survey:
  - Some surveys require parents to explicitly **opt in**
  - Others allow parents to **opt out**
  - Schools must clearly communicate which option applies

We belive that what student surveillance systems count as a survey that can be opted out of by parents.

## Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)

COPPA regulates how websites and apps can collect information from students under 13. Here's what it means for you:

- Websites must get parental consent before collecting information
- Schools can provide consent in place of parents, but only if:
  - The information is used solely for **educational purposes**
  - The website's privacy practices meet federal standards
  - There are no deceptive practices involved

Even if a school provides consent for you, your parents can still opt you out.

## What This Means for You

Understanding these laws helps you protect your rights. Remember:
1. You have legal protections for your privacy
2. Schools must follow specific rules when handling your data
3. You often have the right to know about and control how your information is used
4. There are official channels for complaints if your rights are violated
