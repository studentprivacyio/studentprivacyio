# Who We Are

We're a coalition of students, educators, privacy experts, and digital rights advocates united by a common belief: privacy is fundamental to authentic learning and personal growth. Our diverse backgrounds give us a comprehensive understanding of both educational needs and privacy rights.

## Our Mission

We exist to:
- Empower students with knowledge about their privacy rights in educational settings
- Provide practical tools and guidance for protecting personal privacy
- Support students and families in advocating for privacy-respecting educational practices
- Challenge the normalization of surveillance in educational environments

## Why This Matters

The rapid adoption of educational technology has brought unprecedented levels of surveillance into students' lives. While some monitoring may be necessary, we believe current practices often go too far, creating environments where:

- Creative exploration is stifled by constant observation
- Mental health is impacted by persistent surveillance stress
- Academic freedom is compromised by excessive monitoring
- Personal development is hindered by lack of private space

## What We Do

Our work includes:
- Researching and documenting surveillance practices in education
- Creating accessible resources about student privacy rights
- Providing templates and guides for opting out of invasive monitoring
- Connecting students with legal resources when needed
- Advocating for privacy-respecting educational policies

## Get Involved

We're always looking for people who share our vision of privacy-respecting education. Whether you're a student, educator, parent, or privacy advocate, there are many ways to contribute:

- Share your surveillance experiences
- Help develop educational resources
- Contribute to our documentation
- Support our advocacy efforts
