In a groundbreaking announcement that has left sci-fi authors everywhere banging their heads against their desks, leading student surveillance companies GoGuardian, Lightspeed Systems, Securly, Deledao, and others have partnered to create what they're calling "The Ultimate Learning Analytics Platform," which is definitely not the Torment Nexus from the bestselling novel "Don't Create the Torment Nexus."

"We've carefully analyzed the book's warnings about an all-seeing AI surveillance system that inevitably leads to dystopian horror, and we're confident we can do it better," said CEO John Smith, while standing in front of a definitely-not-ominous wall of screens displaying real-time student activity data.

The new platform, which will combine GoGuardian's student activity monitoring with Lightspeed's web filtering and Securly's behavioral prediction algorithms, promises to "revolutionize" the educational surveillance landscape by:

- Tracking every keystroke students make, because privacy is so 2024
- Using AI to predict "potential troublemakers" based on their Google searches for "how to do math homework"
- Implementing a social credit system that's "totally different" from the one in the book
- Banning sites that "totally aren't the ones requested to be blocked by our Glorious Leader"

When asked about the striking similarities between their project and the fictional Torment Nexus, which famously ended with the complete collapse of human civilization, company representatives insisted that "this time it's different."

"Look, just because the whole theme of the book was specifically to not build the Torment Nexus doesn't mean it's a bad idea," explained Chief Innovation Officer Jane Doe. "Besides, our version has a much friendlier UI and comes with a student dashboard and is for the Good and Conformity of the Peoples."

Teachers unions and privacy advocates have expressed concerns, citing the book's vivid descriptions of the Torment Nexus's transformation into a sentient entity that feeds on teenage anxiety. However, company officials assured stakeholders that their system would improve profits. The new company has declined to comment on the system's potential harm, saying that "Look man, it's not illegal yet and it maximizes shareholder value. What more do you want?"

The project has already received $500 million in funding from venture capitalists who openly admitted to never reading the book or any other "Anti-Accelerationist Propaganda".

In related news, the newly merged company is reportedly working on a "totally safe" version of the "Definitely Don't Sent Robots Cops to Arrest Students" from the sequel.
