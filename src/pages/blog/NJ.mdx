 ## [New Jersey Data Privacy Act (NJDPA)](https://pub.njleg.state.nj.us/Bills/2022/PL23/266_.PDF)

- Comes into effect on January 15, 2025
- Applies to everyone in New Jersey, not just students
- Arguable whether it applies to students at all, as they may not fit the definition of "consumer"
- Could require consent for the collection of "sensitive data"
- Only applies to companies that have at least 100,000 "consumers"
- Could allow students to opt out of data collection and delete their data
- Could also allow students to view their data
- If between 13 and 17 years old, consent is required for "profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal
or similarly significant effects concerning a consumer..."

## [Anti-Big Brother Act](https://pub.njleg.state.nj.us/Bills/2012/PL13/44_.PDF)
- Passed in 2013
- Passed in response to images from student webcams being used by administrators in Pennsylvania

  - The device's recording capabilities (audio/video)
  - That the device may record or collect information about student activities
  - That the school district will not use any capabilities to record or monitor students
  - That parents must acknowledge receipt of this notification in writing
- Applies to any electronic device capable of recording or collecting information about student activities
