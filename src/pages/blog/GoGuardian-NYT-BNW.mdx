GoGuardian, one of if not the most popular student surveillance companies, has featured a [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/health/suicide-monitoring-software-schools.html) comparing student surveillance systems to Brave New World on [their newsroom page](https://www.goguardian.com/newsroom).
The exact title used on the page is "The Brave New World of A.I.-Powered Self Harm Alerts".

The article details how GoGuardian's AI-powered software monitors students' school-issued devices, scanning for concerning content related to self-harm and suicide. In one case described in the article, the system alerted authorities about a student in Neosho, Missouri who had texted about plans to overdose on anxiety medication, potentially saving their life. However, it also highlights concerns about false alarms and privacy, including an incident where police were dispatched to a Connecticut student's home at midnight over a years-old poem.

The only other article featured from a major publication on GoGuardian's newsroom page is a Forbes piece discussing the company's leadership transition. The article, titled "How Rich Preece Successfully Took The Helm Of GoGuardian After Its Founder CEO," focuses on the business aspects of the company rather than its surveillance technology or its impact on students.

It's notable that GoGuardian chose to prominently feature an article that draws parallels between their surveillance technology and Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel, in which the government prioritizes conformity and stability over individual freedoms.
